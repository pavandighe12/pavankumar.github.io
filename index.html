    <h1>Pavankumar Dighe</h1>
    <p>I am Pavankumar Dighe, a PhD graduate from Indian Institute of Science Education & research (IISER) Pune. My thesis supervisor was Vivek Mohan Mallick. Dedicated researcher with extensive industrial research experience and a strong foundation in Mathematics. Proficient in Python programming and statistical analysis, with expertise in financial mathematics, including MPT, CAPM, and the Black-Scholes Model. Skilled in machine learning techniques such as regression, SVM, and PCA. Seeking a role in Quantitative Finance to apply analytical and technical skills in developing data-driven financial models and solutions.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Business Planning Using Monte Carlo Simulation
Objective: Developed a risk analysis model to estimate first-year net
profit for a new product launch, accounting for uncertainties in sales,
price, and costs depending on market situation.
Simulation: Implemented Monte Carlo simulation in Python to model
the impact of uncertainties on net profit.
Outcome: Analyzed simulation results to provide a range of potential
profits, enhancing decision-making and demonstrating the value of
simulation in business planning.
Implementation of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
Objective: Analyzed investment portfolios using Modern Portfolio
Theory (MPT) to construct the efficient frontier.
Key Calculations: Calculated expected returns, risks, and
correlations among assets.
Outcome: Identified optimal risk-return trade-off portfolios,
demonstrating the practical application of financial mathematics in
investment decision-making.
Implementation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
Objective: Developed a Python tool to calculate Beta for single
asset.
Key Calculations: Built a Python tool to calculate Beta using both the
traditional formula and linear regression.
Outcome: Calculated Beta value and visualized the CAPM line,
highlighting the relationship between market and asset returns.
Online Fraud Detection Project
Objective: Developed a machine learning model to detect online
fraud using the Kaggle "Online Payment Fraud Detection" dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Performed exploratory data analysis, handled
class imbalance, and scaled features.
Techniques Used: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision
Trees, Random Forest for fraud detection.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated performance with precision, recall, F1-
score, and AUC-ROC, achieving improved detection rates.
Impact: Enhanced fraud detection accuracy, contributing to safer
online transactions and deepening insights into financial security
applications.</p>
